            <p>Born and brought up in Kuwait, Indian by ancestory, American by naturalization, I could see myself as somewhat global. I know 4 languages and am fluent in 3 of them.</p>
            <p> My family consist of my husband, and two kids.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I currently work at UPS with a title of Applications Development Manager. What that basically means is that I am resonsible for ensuring that IT projects are vetted out, planned, budgeted, resource-assigned, etc.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I need to write a third partgraph about myself. This is getting hard.:)</p>
